## Research at HHZ

Christian researches *data-intensive environments* such as M2M settings, telematic networks and the Internet-of-Things (IoT). 
In these environments, data is perceived as intrinsic property of all entities. Christian develops methods to design and engineer *Smart Data Services* operating on both physical and information entities for closing the gap between physical world and information processing.

Primarily, in the Internet of Things (IoT), Smart Data Services become business relevant first-class resources and enable new business models. As a result, *Data Products* emerge where products and services emboding data intelligence provide novel value propositions to the user. Machine learning and similar approaches are promising technologies in Christian's investigations.
