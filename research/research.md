## Research at HHZ

Christian researches *data-intensive environments* such as M2M settings, telematics services and the Internet of Things (IoT). 
In these environments, data is perceived as an intrinsic property of all entities. Christian develops methods to design and engineer *Smart Data Services* operating on both physical and information entities for closing the gap between the physical world and information processing.

Primarily, in the Internet of Things (IoT), Smart Data Services become business relevant first-class resources and enable new business models. As a result, *Data Products* emerge where products and services emboding data intelligence provide novel value propositions to the user. 

At HHZ Christian investigates technologies like machine and statistical learning, smart networked appliances and cloud-based IoT platforms to build Data Products and to help others to turn data into products.
