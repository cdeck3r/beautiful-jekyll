## Research at HHZ

**Research focus: How to engineer smart data products?**    
**Visit the lab on [Smart Environments](/research/se/) at HHZ**

Christian's research interest is the study of data appliances. As computers pervade our daily life they transform the real world in *data-intensive environments*. Christian develops methods to design and engineer Smart Data Services as mechanisms to exploit computing capabilities therein.

Primarily, in the Internet of Things (IoT), Smart Data Services become business relevant first-class resources and enable new business models. As a result, *Data Products* emerge where products and services emboding data intelligence provide novel value propositions to the user. 

At the HHZ, Christian currently investigates technologies like machine and statistical learning, smart networked appliances and cloud-based IoT platforms to build Data Products and to help others to turn data into products.
