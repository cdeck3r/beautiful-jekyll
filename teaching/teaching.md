## Masters Programmes @HHZ

Lectures on [Services Computing Master (SCM)](http://www.servicescomputingmaster.de/) and [Digital Business Management (DBM)](http://www.digitalbusinessmaster.de/) take place every term at the HHZ. 
Some of them are held in our [Smart Environment](/research/se/) for data driven lecturing (DDL).
