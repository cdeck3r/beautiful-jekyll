**tl;dr - What are Data Driven Lectures?**

*video, tbd*

## Intro

Data Driven Lectures aim at a continuous progress and quality monitoring of my lecturing activities
through the use internet technology. Students attending my lectures use their smartphones, tablet, and laptops to provide feedback on various aspects of a lecture, which enables me to incrementally adapt and improve my lectures. Collected evaluation results display positive effects on balancing material covered, learning speed and effort.

I have implemented Data Driven Lectures within the [BSc. Business Informatics program at the Reutlingen University](http://www.inf.reutlingen-university.de/bachelor/wirtschaftsinformatik-wi/was-ist-wi/).

## Smart Environments

I am pushing the approach forward and have advanced the concept to create *Smart Environment for Teaching and Learning*. This is a classroom embedding various Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies and therein connects lecturing and learning activities directy. It perceives the current situation of all attending students and enables immediate feedback and control on breaks, progress and pace of a lecture. We have implemented a smart classroom environment within the [Services Computing Masters program at the HHZ](http://www.hhz.de/master/services-computing/).

This work is part of ongoing research. Check out *Smart Environments* for further information.
