[Services Computing (SCM)](http://www.hhz.de/master/services-computing/) is an IT Masters program. It teaches the scientfic and engineering methods of IT-focused value creation for the digital business.

We apply these methods to our own program by investigating our students' journey through the program. One project is to provide [SCM as a Data Product](https://github.com/cdeck3r/SCM-DataProduct) to our students. Providing information throughout the program's duration right at your fingertips. A technical implementation of this concept is the use of chatbots to directly answer many of our students' questions.

## Coding Challenge

On June 9, 2017 a group of three students have started a [3-day coding challenge](https://github.com/cdeck3r/SCM-DataProduct/wiki/3-Day-Challenge) in the beautiful city of [Strasbourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg).

The objective was to evaluate the technical feasibility of chatbots to support the data product approach. In quick sprints they tested various frameworks, such as

* Botfather
* Pandorabots
* wit.ai
* Chatfuel
* QnAMaker

The project runs until end of September. Afterwards, we expect to have first bot ready to have regular conversations with our students. We are still looking for the chatbot's name. If you have an idea, drop me mail.
