Part of the curriculum for our students in the masters programme [Services Computing](http://www.hhz.de/master/services-computing/)
is a project where they work as a team on a specific research topic. 
On April 24, 2017, we had our project day, where students presented intermediate and final results. 

The projects below were conducted under my supervision.

## Cognitive Event Correlation

A cognitive event handling service for preventing unnecessary code activationson serverless platforms 
utilizing only relevant events. The topic is greatly introduced on the team's wiki page.

Source: https://github.com/Event-Riddle/MenuCard/wiki/project-definition
>![Proposed solution of Cognitive Event Correlation](https://github.com/Event-Riddle/MenuCard/wiki/images/des-sit.png)
>
> The proposal is to enhance event-based serverless computing platforms (such as OpenWhisk) with event-handling capabilites. 
> This event-handling component is either supposed to be pre-pended or integrated with the platform and is supposed to handle large amounts of incoming events (event-storms). 
> In order to address the said deficiencies, the Event-Correlator is supposed to consist of different functionalities. These include:
>
>* Event-Filtering
>* Event-Aggregation
>* Event-Maskinging
>* Event-De-Duplicating
>* Event-Correlation


For the complete code and documentation have a look at the
[project's repo](https://github.com/Event-Riddle/MenuCard/wiki)(lang=ger).

## Business Model Crunching alias CABgen

Business model crunching was the initial name for a project on computer aided business generation (CABgen).

While the digital transformation leads to development and adjustment of new business models, 
structured and fast methods are needed to collaboratively communicate on business models. Canvas methods have become
one well-known instrument in this area. Alternative names are canvas models, lean canvas, busines model canvas.
They are 

* Structured :-)
* Systematic :-)
* Creative :-)
* ... , but also manual and time consuming :-(

The project's objective is to *Ease the Process of Lean Canvas Generation*. 
It does so utilizing a fast and explorative support by means of a recommendation system. 
Herein, the computer is an active participant in the process of canvas creation.

## SCM as a Data Product

Services Computing as a Data Product, aims to enhance the SCM processes with more data intelligence. 
It provides immediate and valueable information as well as new information services to master students.

* Product details: decision support for candidates
* Support: directed and faster responses to organisational questions
* Feedback: data-based feedback and stronger binding between users (students) and maker (professors) for continuous evolution

Customer segment / target audience

* Prospective SCM candidates
* SCM students
* Alumni
