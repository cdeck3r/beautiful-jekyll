The 2-day IoT hackathon in the [masters programme "Services Computing" (SCM)](http://www.hhz.de/master/services-computing/) has finished. 
Students were introduced to the [Living Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_lab) process and implemented various IoT application use cases 
using the [Bluemix](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/) IoT platform. Following the process and for the sake of the hackathon, they started in the exploration phase.
Using their know-how from the IoT lecture and other SCM lectures, students presented their ideas conceptionally and 
as a design for a minimum valuable product ([MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)). Finally, this MVP was implemented and demonstrated 
at the end of the 2nd day of the hackathon.

All projects are publicly available. Checkt out the following links:

* [Alexa IoT Assisstant](https://bitbucket.org/iotalexahhz/iotalexahhz/wiki/Home): Using Amazons Alexa Assisstant for GUI-less IoT services 
* [IoT Lever-Action Coffee Airpot](https://github.com/miwurster/msc-iot-kaffeekanne): measure the current coffee level at HHZ's coffee pot, share it via app and notify users via Twitter.
* [Smart Home](https://github.com/glasbran/Hackathon---Homeautomation): MVP (Minimum Viable Product) services for an home automation system

Thanks to all students from the SCM IoT course of the summer term 2016.

Cheers,
Christian
