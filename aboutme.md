Christian is a computer science professor at the [Herman Hollerith Center (HHZ)](http://www.hhz.de) in BÃ¶blingen, a research center of the [Reutlingen University](http://reutlingen-university.de/). He researches novel methods, architectures and technologies for services computing in data-intensive environments including M2M settings, telematic networks and the Internet-of-Things (IoT). Results are part of his lectures for master students about the Internet-of-Things (IoT). 

Christian has received both his diploma degree in computer science and his PhD from the University of Karlsruhe, now KIT.  
In his academic career he was a scientist in the area of "Ubiquitous Computing" at [TecO](http://www.teco.edu), where he has published on Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies and their use in various industrial applications. He has held lead positions in several public-private-partnerships as well as in publicly funded research projects. 
After his PhD he started a professional career in statistical analysis of mass data collected by vehicle onboard computers in public transport. Such data is used for detailed vehicle / fleet performance reports as well as for public transport optimization. Christian also contributed to the field of driving behavior analysis and filed several patents on this subject.
